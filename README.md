🛠️ Building a Production-Ready ETL Pipeline: My Complete Data Engineering Journey with Python
📌 Project Overview

This repository showcases the development of a robust, production-ready ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline utilizing Python, PostgreSQL, and Apache Airflow. The project automates the process of extracting raw sales data from CSV files, transforming and cleaning the data, and loading it into a PostgreSQL database for further analysis.

🧱 Technologies Used

Python: Core scripting language for ETL operations.

PostgreSQL: Relational database for storing processed data.

Apache Airflow: Workflow orchestration for automating and scheduling ETL tasks.

Docker: Containerization of the application for consistency across environments.

psycopg2: PostgreSQL adapter for Python.

SQLAlchemy: SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python.

🛠️ Setup & Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/etl-pipeline-python-postgresql-airflow.git
cd etl-pipeline-python-postgresql-airflow


Build and start the Docker containers:

docker-compose up --build


Access Apache Airflow UI at http://localhost:8080 and trigger the etl_pipeline_dag to run the ETL process.

🔄 ETL Workflow
1. Extract

Source: Raw sales data in CSV format.

Process: Utilizes Python's pandas library to read and load CSV data into a DataFrame.

2. Transform

Operations: Data cleaning and transformation using pandas.

Tasks:

Handle missing or invalid entries.

Standardize formats (e.g., product names, numbers).

Calculate new fields (e.g., total_amount = quantity × price).

3. Load

Destination: PostgreSQL database.

Process: Use SQLAlchemy and psycopg2 to insert transformed data into the database.

🧪 Testing

Unit tests are implemented for each ETL component:

test_extract.py: Validates data extraction logic.

test_transform.py: Ensures data transformation correctness.

test_load.py: Confirms data loading into PostgreSQL.

Run tests using:

pytest

📈 Data Visualization

The processed data can be used for various analytical purposes, such as:

Generating sales reports.

Identifying top-selling products.

Analyzing sales trends over time.

🧠 Key Learnings

Automation: Streamlined the ETL process with Apache Airflow.

Data Integrity: Ensured data quality through rigorous transformation steps.

Scalability: Designed the pipeline to handle increasing data volumes.

Containerization: Achieved environment consistency using Docker.
